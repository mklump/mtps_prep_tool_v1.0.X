              <content xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5"><p>Microsoft Consulting Services assists customers in evaluating, planning, and executing migration from IBM mainframes and other operating systems to the Microsoft Windows Server System. It offers three pre-migration services: </p><ul><li><p>Migration Assessment</p></li><li><p>Migration Discovery (or Code and Data Discovery)</p></li><li><p>Pilot Migration or Proof of Concept (POC)</p></li></ul><p>These services are described at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/mainframe/migrationservices.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/mainframe/migrationservices.mspx</a>.</p><sections xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5"><H3 class="subHeading">Migration Assessment</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>This is a short project typically lasting two to three days. Its main goal is to build a high-level picture of the mainframe environment, including the applications and data, and the primary operational flows. The assessment process identifies candidate applications for migration and sets the stage for a subsequent discovery.</p><p>To identify the candidate applications, the project team defines several criteria against which the applications are measured—for example, estimated migration effort and risk balanced against potential savings in mainframe resource usage and/or license fees. The assessment also considers the business drivers for migration; these business drivers are often stronger than the economics in the case of legacy applications because they drive the need to enhance the agility and adaptability of these legacy applications. The assessment process describes and evaluates alternative migration strategies: re-platform, transform, replace, or replacement with a packaged commercial application.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="note" src="local/note.gif"/>Note:</th></tr><tr><td><p>Details about these migration or modernization strategies have already been described in Chapter 2 of this guide.</p></td></tr><p/></table></div><p>The assessment process also considers the readiness of the enterprise data center for implementing the Windows Server platform. </p><p>The assessment also delivers an estimate of the cost of migrating to a Windows Server platform and provides an estimate of the potential savings that might be achieved. These items respectively determine the “investment” and “return” parts of an ROI calculation. </p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="note" src="local/note.gif"/>Note:</th></tr><tr><td><p>An in-depth ROI/TCO analysis of a migration project is outside the scope of this guide.</p></td></tr><p/></table></div><p>Some enterprises may have already completed an assessment of their mainframe applications and of the readiness of these applications to be hosted by a Windows Server System and the .NET Framework. If this is the case with your applications, then you are ready to start with Migration Discovery as described in the following section.</p></content><H3 class="subHeading">Migration Discovery</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The discovery process typically follows and builds upon the results of Migration Assessment. Its goal is to determine the feasibility of migration, to evaluate alternative migration paths, and to estimate the cost of migrating existing applications and associated data to the target Windows-based environment.</p><p>A Discovery is usually completed in 3 to 5 weeks, but it can vary depending on the size and complexity of the customer’s mainframe environment. A typical Discovery will include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Pre-workshop code analysis.</b> A pre-workshop code analysis is an efficient way to prepare for the subsequent on-site workshop. For mainstream mainframe batch and online applications written in COBOL (for example, IBM CICS), MCS analyzes the source code, job control language (JCL), and primary system definitions using Microsoft’s proprietary code scanner. For other environments, MCS often sub-contracts this analysis to a partner.</p></li><li><p><b>Workshop.</b> A three to four day workshop is held at the customer’s site. During this workshop, the output of the code analysis is reviewed and, through discussion, is given an architectural and operational context.</p></li><li><p><b>Post-workshop report.</b> Following the workshop, the team will analyze the gathered information and document its conclusions and recommendations in a report. This report contains information suitable for inclusion in a migration RFP.</p></li></ul><p>Although the major focus in the discovery process is on data and the applications that process this data, the discovery process also looks at data center operations and systems management in the existing environment.</p></content><H3 class="subHeading">Pilot Migration or Proof of Concept</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The pilot migration or proof-of-concept (POC) will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy. A pilot migration is of a subset of the programs that comprise the applications that the prior A&amp;D process identified as candidates for migration to the Windows platform. It is selected jointly by MCS and your IT staff. Ideally, a pilot migration moves the selected application into the new production environment. However, a pilot migration is more than just the migration of pilot data and applications; it also includes pilot testing, production staging, systems support and management processes, and tools and techniques. MCS recommends that members of your staff actively participate in the pilot or proof-of-concept project.</p></content></sections></content>

In addition to analyzing the COBOL code, Visual Evolve scans the JCL of IBM z/OS batch applications. It also scans any DB2 data definitions and CICS definition tables (FCT, PCT, and so on). Visual Evolve can recognize CICS and DB2 programming constructs and is designed specifically to: </p><ul><li><p>Discover if all parts of the application are present by following the program call chains starting with the batch JCL STEP statements and top-level CICS programs. </p></li><li><p>Identify known migration issues within the programs and JCL. </p></li></ul><p>For other environments, in particular for non-relational databases such as IDMS or ADABAS, MCS typically enlists the services of a partner specialized in those technologies for the code and/or the data structure analysis. </p><p>Visual Evolve is a tool that ensures a complete inventory of all code that is to be migrated, and it also ensures a complete inventory of all data referenced by that code. It is especially useful in cases where existing code is to be preserved. Visual Evolve does not document program or extract any logic or “rules.” There is no need for analysis or reporting on code that is expected to compile and function correctly without any changes on the Windows platform. </p></content></content>

              <content xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5"><p>This section describes in more detail how Microsoft Services executes its assessment, discovery, and pilot migration projects, and it describes the different outputs for each of these three services.</p><p>The assessment/discovery projects of MCS conform to Microsoft’s proven development methodology: Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). MSF consists of five phases (see Figure 1):</p><ul><li><p><b>Envisioning.</b> The Envisioning Phase of MSF creates a business vision and defines the scope of work necessary to bring the vision to reality, such as business case justification or business studies, and identifies risk factors and intended audience. Migration assessment is envisioning.</p></li><li><p><b>Planning.</b> The Planning Phase produces the design specifications for the system and application architectures, defines a prototype, and delivers a detailed project plan covering all aspects of the project. Migration Discovery completes envisioning and begins migration planning.</p></li><li><p><b>Developing.</b> The Developing Phase implements the specifications of the system design and builds the system until it is ready for full system testing.</p></li><li><p><b>Stabilizing.</b> The system is tested in the Stabilizing Phase until it passes the acceptance criteria defined by the stabilization team.</p></li><li><p><b>Deploying.</b> The Deploying Phase includes final development, release management, and deployment.</p></li></ul><img src="art/fee37038-c366-481b-bc44-101404b7a63b.gif"/><p><b>Figure 8.1.

At the end of an assessment, you should be able to envision that it is possible to undertake a migration project by adopting one of the migration strategies.</p><H4 class="subHeading">Assessment Team</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The project team consists of staff from Microsoft Consulting Services. However, the project team expects selected members of your business and IT departments to participate and contribute to the effort. The team will need contributions from managers and staff from the applications development, data center or operations management, technical support (systems programming), and sometimes database administration groups within your IT department.</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Questionnaire and Other Documents</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>To ensure that the project team focuses its assessment efforts and works efficiently, MCS recommends that your IT staff should prepare the following items and have them ready before the project gets under way:</p><ul><li><p>Information about the IBM mainframe computer(s) in your organization, their model numbers, the number of processors and their RAM, and so on. This information should preferably be presented in a system configuration diagram. The information should also include the following: monthly lease cost if the machine(s) are leased, typical monthly costs if the machines are on measured usage charges, and the monthly maintenance cost of the computers. Any lease expiration dates or other systems life “inflection points” should also be identified.</p></li><li><p>Identification of the LPAR configuration on the computers, the MIPS assigned to each, and applications that run in the LPAR.</p></li><li><p>Inventory of all IBM software installed and in use in your organization, including the release numbers of each such software item along with its respective monthly or annual cost.</p></li><li><p>Inventory of all third-party software installed and in use in your organization, including the release number of each such software along with its annual license or maintenance cost and any anticipated upgrade/replacement costs.</p></li><li><p>A sample monthly service level report showing:</p><ul><li><p>Elapsed times and completion times of batch processes measured against deadlines.</p></li><li><p>Total and peak transaction rates and response times of online applications.</p></li><li><p>System resource utilization reports, grouped by applications and showing statistics for CPU usage and I/O exceptions.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Any pending or expected events that might require an upgrade to the environment and related changes that would result in either one-time or different ongoing hardware or software costs. Examples of such events include:</p><ul><li><p>Capacity upgrades/downgrades.</p></li><li><p>Release upgrades.</p></li><li><p>End of life on hardware or software, or end of normal support period.</p></li><li><p>IBM pricing model changes.</p></li></ul></li></ul></content><H4 class="subHeading">Migration Strategies Review</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The project team reviews the migration strategies that are available (described in Chapter 2). The team reviews the migration tools and techniques associated with each migration strategy and discusses Microsoft’s partners that possess migration expertise and that can be called upon to assist with a migration. The project team also discusses examples of successful migrations during this review session.</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Facilities</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The project team typically conducts the assessment at your site. However, you can opt to conduct the assessment at an Envisioning Center located at a Microsoft Technology Center or at some other Microsoft location. The benefit of this option is that it isolates your project staff from the distractions of day-to-day normal tasks and duties of their respective positions in your organization. Consequently, they will be able to better concentrate on assessment tasks during the workshop. Additional Microsoft consultants with expertise in a variety of technology areas can be readily brought into the workshop to contribute to the assessment process.</p></content></content><H3 class="subHeading">Assessment Deliverables</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The Migration Assessment customer deliverable is a report of assessment findings, often delivered in the form of a presentation that provides a vision of a successful migration.</p></content><H3 class="subHeading">Migration Discovery</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The intent of a Mainframe Discovery project is to determine the feasibility of migration, to evaluate alternative migration paths, and to estimate the cost to migrate existing applications and associated data. Initially, MCS endeavors to preserve as much of the current business logic as possible—that is, to preserve as much of the existing code as possible. In situations where application code and data cannot be migrated, or the existing application does not meet business or agency needs, the Discovery Service can be used to create an inventory of existing programs and data that can be used as a “specification” for replacing the old with new program development. </p><H4 class="subHeading">Project Team</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The project team is composed of two Microsoft MCS architects, or an MCS architect and a senior MCS consultant. However, Microsoft expects your organization to designate staff fulltime to the project so that they participate in the project and contribute productively to its work. The project team will issue pre-visit guidelines to you to facilitate project readiness before the project team’s arrival.</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Pre-Workshop Application Code Analysis</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>Before meeting with your people, the Microsoft Discovery team will use its Visual Evolve tool described above to scan all COBOL program source, copybooks, JCL, and procedures (PROCs) and certain CICS definitions. This scanning tool will:</p><ul><li><p>Identify code within these programs known to require manual change for migration.</p></li><li><p>Discover all databases, CICS datasets, and file assignments used in these programs, and identify database or file usage known to require manual change for migration. </p></li><li><p>Analyze JCL streams and associated PROCs to identify third-party and IBM system utilities in use and to verify that there are no missing programs.</p></li><li><p>Identify other sources from which the application has been built. </p></li></ul><p>For a CICS and/or batch COBOL Discovery, MCS uses its own Visual Evolve tool to scan code and JCL to automate much of the code discovery. For other languages such as PL/I or Natural, MCS may use a tool from a third-party product or service partner. In the case where an automated tool is not available, MCS use its best effort to perform a manual analysis of the code. </p><p>It is extremely valuable to also have a means to group programs and jobs into sets or units of applications or sub-applications or areas. Sometimes this can be done with an understanding of program and job naming conventions. Sometimes this requires a list of areas and programs that belong to those areas. If program groups and the online “tops” transaction can be identified, then analysis and reporting can be segregated into meaningful units and reported with meaningful names. </p></content><H4 class="subHeading">On-Site Discovery Workshop</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The Discovery Workshop generally will consist of the following activities:</p><ul><li><p>Architectural overview</p></li><li><p>Analysis of applications and development processes</p></li><li><p>Analysis of data and data management </p></li><li><p>Analysis of the data center configuration and operations</p></li><li><p>Current costs assessment</p></li><li><p>Migration scenario review</p></li></ul><p>During these activities, MCS will conduct interviews with: </p><ul><li><p>Developers to understand the application, its data sources, composition, and usage. </p></li><li><p>Data or database administrator regarding the application’s use of data. </p></li><li><p>Data center and Operations management or other staff about service level commitments and achievement. </p></li><li><p>Mainframe operations and systems programming about the application’s activity volumes (batch or online transactions), performance, and resource usage characteristics.</p></li></ul><p>The Discovery team will also want to meet with IT management before the formal workshop begins to assess management’s current migration understanding and objectives. </p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Architectural Overview</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>Often the best start to a Discovery workshop is a customer presentation of an architectural overview that describes how the data center is configured and gives an overview of the major applications.</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Applications and Development Processes Discovery</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The Discovery team will meet with applications management and staff to acquire an understanding of the current applications. These discussions will identify the programming languages and tools and other technologies used in this application and their general design. The discussions will also focus on how data is processed through these applications and the data flow between applications. The Database Administration staff should normally be included in these discussions.</p><p>The discussion will also focus on developer productivity and will identify any unmet needs to modernize or simply retain the existing applications. Increased developer productivity and the ability to shorten the backlog of changes to an application can be a strong motivator toward migration because the inability to make timely changes to applications can lead to missed business opportunity costs.</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Data and Data Management Discovery</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The Discovery team will analyze the data organization, storage, and usage along with the systems and processes that manage the data. In a smaller organization, this analysis may be carried out with the development team, the data center management, or an architect or systems programmer. In a larger organization, the analysis would normally be carried out with a database administrator, architect, or manager.</p><p>In addition to understanding the structure(s) in which the data is stored, the team will need to understand the data-oriented processes in use. For example, it is not uncommon to use a utility to process DB2 transaction logs and retrieve transactions to undo (“back out”) changes to the data made in error by a specific application or program. In a high-activity environment, there might be extensive use of DB2 table partitioning.</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Data Center Configuration and Operations Discovery</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The Discovery team will interview data center operations management to acquire information about how the data center is run and to obtain their perspective on the applications. Data center personnel usually know the activity volumes (batch or online transactions), performance, and resource usage characteristics and other operational characteristics of the applications. </p><p>The team also needs to discover what tools and techniques are used for system monitoring and management, service level tracking and reporting, and production problem determination and correction. This discussion should identify any “pain points” such as SLA attainment, tight “batch windows,” and recurrent application failures that affect service level attainment. Lead application support or technical support (Systems Programming) or management can make important contributions to this discussion and should therefore participate in them. Systems programmers usually have the best understanding of complex system-level configuration such as the deployment of CICS regions in an IBM Parallel Sysplex environment.</p><p>The discussion should also include the current data center costs for hardware and software. A universal benefit of migration is more computing capacity and greatly reduced costs, with no loss of reliability, availability, security, or overall effectiveness.</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Customer Contribution to the Discovery Planning Process</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>A Migration Discovery requires that the customer:</p><ul><li><p>Be available for interviews by the MCS Discovery team. </p></li><li><p>Provide copies of all of the application program code, JCL, and database definitions. These must be provided at least one week before the on-site workshop, and their format should be in ASCII encoded files for direct usage on Windows.</p></li><li><p>Allow active participation of technical staff and management with the Microsoft Discovery team, both during and after the workshop.</p></li></ul><p>All program source code should be downloaded to a file system accessible from Windows (for example, to a file server or a workstation) and written to removable media that is readable by Windows (for example, a CD or DVD) that is sent to Microsoft. Alternatively, the source code may be placed on an FTP server from which it can be “received” by Microsoft using a standard FTP client program. It is desirable to place the source code on a Windows file system directory that preserves some of the metadata about the files obtained from the source code repository. For example, it is desirable to keep the COBOL programs separate from the COPY files either by file name extension or by placing them in a separate directory. It is also desirable to keep JCL in a separate directory or to name them with a representative file name extension such as .jcl.</p><p>The customer should expect that the Discovery team may identify missing items that will need to be located and made available. This “missing pieces discovery” is usually an iterative process that will repeat several times until all parts of the application are found.</p><p>MCS will provide pre-visit planning guidelines to enable your IT department to be ready for the Discovery team’s arrival. </p></content></content><H3 class="subHeading">Discovery Deliverables</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The discovery project delivers information needed to develop a high-level plan to migrate the candidate application(s) that were identified in the assessment project. Specifically, the discovery project delivers the following: </p><ul><li><p>Recommendations about the mainframe migration strategy along with an implementation roadmap consisting of chosen design elements for all architectural components discussed during the project. </p></li><li><p>Identification of applications that are candidates for migration and the criteria by which they were selected. One example of the selection criteria is the relative migration effort and risk balanced against the potential mainframe resource usage reduction and/or license fee elimination. </p></li><li><p>Inventory and description of the applications and their components to be included in a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).</p></li><li><p>For applications written in COBOL, a database of information about the programs. This information can be used for further analysis of the application’s source code and its components.</p></li><li><p>Preliminary summary risk assessment of the operational environment and a preliminary discussion of options for data center operations migration and support.</p></li><li><p>Business case that provides a cost analysis of the legacy mainframe systems, the proposed solution architecture, effort associated with migration, and a projected ROI for the migration project. </p></li></ul></content></content>

              <content xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5"><p>MCS can complement the A&amp;D services of Microsoft’s partners by providing its expertise to define and develop the new Windows-based environment and to manage the migration of applications and data to this new environment. MCS also offers migration assistance services that are particularly valuable during migration, especially in the areas of best practice tools usage and Windows platform integration for manageability, security, and related areas. </p><p>There are three main areas of expertise in which MCS offers particular value to define and create the new Windows-based target environment:</p><ul><li><p><b>Creation of a development architecture.</b> This service designs and creates the development architecture of the target environment. It deploys Microsoft Visual Studio® Team System for team-based collaboration both during migration and for ongoing software maintenance and new development. This team-based collaboration includes project management as well as development, testing, and versioning source code control. </p></li><li><p><b>Definition of the execution environment for migrated applications.</b> This service chooses appropriate system configurations and settings comparable to those made by a mainframe systems programmer. Security integration and setting are included.</p></li><li><p><b>Establishment of management and operations architecture.</b> This service defines and establishes the production architecture for management and operation of the migrated applications. This service also includes tools and processes for timely detection of problems and determination of their root causes.</p></li><li><p><b>Additional services.</b> MCS can also assist with the use of Microsoft products and technologies such as Host Integration Server (HIS) for mainframe data access and migration and bi-directional transactional integration, and Microsoft SQL Server® for data storage and access and overall .NET development, deployment, and management. This includes migration of data into SQL Server, for example using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) reading data mainframe through the HIS data providers for DB2 or VSAM.</p></li></ul></content>
