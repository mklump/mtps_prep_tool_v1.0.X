              This chapter provides an overview of a typical assessment/discovery (A&amp;D) process
              and explains why enterprises should consider undertaking an A&amp;D project. It
              describes the technology challenge facing enterprises that rely on mainframe environments
              to achieve their business objectives, and it recommends that the best first step
              an enterprise can take to respond to this challenge is to undertake an A&amp;D project
              with the help of experienced A&amp;D experts.</p>

            <div id="sectionSection0" class="section">
              <content xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5"><p>The capabilities of alternative hardware-based information technology (IT) and new paradigms today confront enterprises with an opportunity and a challenge. These new platforms, specifically the Windows Server System™, can now provide the reliability, availability, security, and serviceability formerly only available from mainframe and other higher-end systems. These new technologies offer enterprises the opportunity to increase their business performance and competitiveness and at the same time reduce ongoing operating costs. The following are among the major new developments creating this challenge:</p><ul><li><p><b>Object-oriented analysis, design, and programming.</b> The key principle in the object-oriented paradigm is that direct access to data should be restricted to those applications that encode only the business rules governing the data. For example, employee data should be maintained by applications that implement only the rules for the employee entity or <i>object</i>. Other applications—for example, customer, sales, or payroll—must obtain employee data by requesting it from the employee application. However, most legacy applications have been written in procedural programming languages that do not adhere to this principle. The challenge here is how to modernize these applications using object-oriented principles and programming languages. </p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="note" src="local/note.gif"/>Note:</th></tr><tr><td><p>A very readable overview of the object-oriented paradigm can be found in the short book, <i>Object Technology: A Manager’s Guide</i>, by David A. Taylor (Pearson Education, Second Edition, 1997).</p></td></tr><p/></table></div></li><li><p><b>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).</b> The fundamental idea in the SOA paradigm is that service—an activity or a series of activities that a software system performs at the request of another software system or user—is the main principle guiding the design of enterprise-level IT architecture. An SOA delivers services through interfaces that adhere to open standards and that are independent of the underlying platform or programming languages. Since most legacy applications are built around business functions, the challenge here is how to transform them into interoperating independent open services.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="note" src="local/note.gif"/>Note:</th></tr><tr><td><p>A useful introduction to Service-Oriented Architecture can be found in the Microsoft document, “Service Orientation and its Role in Your Connected Systems Strategy” at <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954826.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954826.aspx</a>.</p></td></tr><p/></table></div></li><li><p><b>Open standards.</b> Open standards enable enterprises to implement SOA. The challenge here is that legacy applications use OEM (original equipment manufacturer) proprietary interfaces and protocols such as Systems Network Architecture (SNA) from IBM. These technologies would need to be extended to open standards such as those implemented by Web services.</p></li><li><p><b>Sophisticated software systems on commodity-based hardware.</b> In the past, sophisticated operating systems and support “middleware” were available only on corresponding hardware systems provided by the same company. Today, sophisticated software systems such as Windows Server System run on computer systems built around commodity processors from AMD and INTEL and store their data on storage area networks (SANs) built around commodity disk drives. This phenomenon has driven down the cost of enterprise computing to a level that is dramatically less than the cost of, for example, IBM mainframe computing.</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="note" src="local/note.gif"/>Note:</th></tr><tr><td><p>In addition to the Windows Server OS, other examples of operating systems formerly available only on proprietary hardware and now available on AMD-based and INTEL-based systems include HP/UX and Solaris.</p></td></tr><p/></table></div></li></ul><p>These new technologies and paradigms present enterprises with the choice of modernizing their mainframe environments either on their existing mainframe platforms or on the newly capable platforms. Whichever option they choose, they need to prepare themselves to meet these new challenges.</p></content>

Thus, an understanding of these generic characteristics of the mainframe environment provides a useful framework in which to appreciate the need for assessment/discovery.  </p><p>The mainframe environment is the product of decades of changes in the business, technological, and legal environments. Enterprises responded to these changes by adding new functionalities to the original applications and by implementing new custom-developed software or software developed by independent software vendors. Some of the major factors contributing to the mainframe environment’s complexity include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Multiple and incompatible vendor products.</b> The technologies of these vendor products were often incompatible with each other. Consequently, additional software had to be developed as interfaces to ensure interoperability among these mutually incompatible components. These solutions, in turn, led to duplication of processes and data. They also complicated the operational and maintenance procedures in the mainframe environment. All these actions increased the complexity of the evolving environment.</p></li><li><p><b>Non-uniform distribution of complexity.</b> The complexity of the typical mainframe environment is not uniformly distributed, nor is this complexity fully understood. It is the imperfectly understood parts of the environment, and the interdependencies between these parts and the rest of the environment, that may cause serious problems during a migration project. </p></li><li><p><b>Other reasons for complexity.</b> There may be additional reasons why some areas of the mainframe environment are extremely difficult to understand. For example, documentation may be incomplete, missing, or obsolete; parts of the programming logic in mission-critical applications may have become incomprehensible, a state of affairs made worse by the loss of knowledgeable programmers; critical business knowledge may have been lost due to the loss of domain experts; program source code may be missing; and so on.</p></li></ul></content><H3 class="subHeading">Modernization Issues Raised by the Mainframe Environment</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The complexity of the mainframe environment raises issues that must be identified and resolved in order to discover the best migration strategy and minimize the risks involved in a migration project. The following examples highlight some key areas of the mainframe environment that could raise migration issues.</p><H4 class="subHeading">Data Center and Operations</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The data center is the foundation of the mainframe environment. A thorough knowledge of a data center’s various parts and operations—for example, physical structure, hardware and software, network connections, roles and procedures—is critical for assessing the best way to transform it into a data center based on the Windows platform. The following are some of the issues that a migration project may face:</p><ul><li><p><b>Operating system.</b> Mainframe operating systems and the processes that have built up around them include a wide range of functions based on the specifics of how those systems work and often upon the capabilities and limitations present at the time those systems were developed. Some of these functions may not be necessary in the Windows environment, or they might be approached in a very different manner. What is the best way to address this issue? There may even be other operating systems present besides the IBM operating systems—for example, Unisys, Linux, and UNIX. What should be done about these operating systems and their functions?</p></li><li><p><b>Storage systems.</b> How will the disk, tape, backup, and archival storage systems map to the Windows platform? What should be done about the mainframe tapes? Should applications-based storage management be retained or should it be moved more into a SAN and a formal “hierarchical storage manager”? Given the favorable economics of disk storage on Windows Server systems, are there cases where tape as the storage medium can be discarded in favor of just keeping the data on disk? </p></li><li><p><b>Procedures, roles, skills.</b> What will be the post-migration fate of the procedures, roles, and skills associated with running the mainframe data center? For example, how will production control and report/print distribution be handled in the new environment? What will be the fate of such key roles as the system programmer? Will the role of the mainframe system administrator map to the role of the system administrator in the Windows environment? Should the data center staff be replaced or retrained?</p></li><li><p><b>Other.</b> The data center also includes the following areas that may raise issues for migration: availability management, capacity management, system management, job scheduling, problem detection and correction, change management, network configuration and management, security and disaster recovery, accounting and chargeback system, release management, and service level agreements.</p></li></ul></content><H4 class="subHeading">Interactive Facilities</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>Mainframe users generally manage files, batch jobs, and libraries through interactive facilities such as ISPF running under TSO (the z/OS Time Sharing Option) or third-party alternatives such as Wylbur. What should be done about the services provided by these interactive facilities? Is a Windows Remote Desktop a suitable alternative or can these tasks be accomplished by access to these files on a network file share? Some “personal” or departmental applications—for example, those written in the CLIST and REXX languages—may use TSO commands to build and submit production jobs and perform other system functions. What should be done about these applications?</p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Applications</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The complexity of the applications environment resides primarily in its legacy applications. The overwhelming majority of these applications were written in COBOL twenty or more years ago. Many of these applications have evolved through as-needed maintenance and enhancements into convoluted systems that are often undocumented and often not fully understood even by the shop’s most experienced programmers. However, these applications embody the business rules of the enterprise; while their lack of structure and immensity makes it extremely difficult to identify all these business rules.</p><p>The applications environment poses a wide range of migration project challenges. Some of these are:</p><ul><li><p><b>COBOL programs.</b> Should these be rewritten in an object-oriented language such as Visual Basic.NET, C#, or even Object Oriented COBOL for .NET to take advantage of the.NET Framework, or should they be retained with their current structure and simply be compiled for and run on the Windows Server platform instead of on z/OS? Perhaps the best approach is a hybrid approach to re-write selected programs while leaving others in COBOL. </p></li><li><p><b>Other programming languages.</b> It is not uncommon to encounter programs written in other programming languages—for example, NATURAL, FORTRAN, PL/I, RPG,—or “4GL” report generators such as MARK IV, DYLXX0, and EASYTRIEVE. Should these be replaced with powerful Windows platform tools such as SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) or Integration Services (SSIS), or if COBOL is retained should they be converted to COBOL?</p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="note" src="local/note.gif"/>Note:</th></tr><tr><td><p>Some organizations store portions of enterprise data outside the mainframe platform, and this data maybe be stored in non-mainframe formats and maintained by commercial applications such as EXCEL or systems written in programming languages not typically found on a mainframe such as PASCAL. See the following section, “Data and Databases,” for more on this subject. </p></td></tr><p/></table></div></li><li><p><b>Business knowledge of mainframe programmers.</b> Mainframe programmers are a critical source of knowledge about the legacy systems and the business rules that are programmed into the code in these legacy systems. What is the best path for future application maintenance and development? While some of the existing mainframe programming staff will soon retire, others will remain for many years. What will it take to retrain staff in the new technologies? Will it be more effective to keep the COBOL and the current application designs, and retrain only in the new platform environment, or would it better to move to a fresh new design and language?</p></li></ul></content><H4 class="subHeading">Data and Databases</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The data that is stored and maintained (and created) by these mainframe systems is a critical business asset. The data asset is more precious even than the applications programs that, however difficult they might be to maintain, can be replaced. On the other hand, if the data is lost, it might not be replaceable.</p><p>The issue of mainframe data preservation and migration must be addressed separately from or with the programming code that maintains it. The following list shows only some of the issues:</p><ul><li><p><b>Duplicate and problem data.</b> Legacy applications contain a certain amount of invalid or incorrect data. What should be done about this data? Should it be corrected before migration or after migration? Can it be left as is? Would correcting this data cause more business discontinuity than if it is left “wrong”?</p></li><li><p><b>Sequential files and databases. </b>Should mainframe sequential files and VSAM ESDS be converted to SQL Server tables, or should they be retained as sequential files in the new Windows-based environment? If they are moved to SQL Server, will the design principles of the new SQL tables conform to SQL best practices, or will they be tables that store rows of data fields that are opaque to SQL, that is, fields that can be understood only in the code?</p></li><li><p><b>Data stored in VSAM.</b> What should be done with data stored in VSAM Key Sequence Data Sets (KSDS) and the applications that access this data? Should this data be converted to a SQL data base or be left and used in a VSAM-like manner?</p></li><li><p><b>Data warehouses.</b> Data warehouses extract data from legacy databases and files. If the legacy data is migrated to the Windows platform, what should be done with data warehouses and the applications that use them?</p></li><li><p><b>Mainframe data on non-mainframe platforms.</b> Some organizations maintain portions of their enterprise data on non-mainframe platforms. For example, the various program units of a state government department may maintain their respective collections data on the Windows platform through such applications as Microsoft Access, Excel, or other applications. This data may not be processed by any mainframe application. Any project to migrate the enterprise data to a new .NET system on Windows will need to integrate this non-mainframe data and their applications into the new system. How should such applications and data be migrated to the new application?</p></li><li><p><b>Data stored at other enterprises.</b> Data may also reside with other enterprises such as outsourcing vendors who operate call centers or provide other services such as payroll, billing, credit card, and collection services. How will migration affect exchange and use of this off-site data? Will the interfaces with these partners be changed or must the exact same interfaces be implemented by the new or migrated applications? </p></li></ul></content><H4 class="subHeading">Batch Processes</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>Batch processes constitute one of the most important areas of the mainframe environment because the batch process is often the heavy workload of these mission-critical systems where the core business logic is applied to the data and the “data of record” is maintained, that is, where the master files and databases are updated. How will the new Windows-based environment handle batch processing? Some batch jobs do not reside in static production libraries but are built dynamically and submitted to batch by online applications or other batch jobs. How should these jobs be handled in the new environment? For z/OS systems, will the JCL be retained and run by a “JES emulator,” or should the JCL be converted to a native Windows technology? Which Windows technology? </p></content><H4 class="subHeading">Interfaces</H4><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The mainframe environment includes various types of interfaces—for example, terminal user interfaces, application-application interfaces within the mainframe, and enterprise-enterprise and platform-platform interfaces that are normally network interfaces often using mainframe-specific or industry-standard protocols or formats. Which of these different types of interfaces should be preserved, and which should be transformed or replaced by new approaches? Any change to the end users will require retraining and may cause disruption during transition to the new environment. How would such requirements affect migration decisions?</p></content></content></sections></content>

            <div id="sectionSection2" class="section">
              <content xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5"><p>This section outlines the three components of a typical A&amp;D process: a framework of understanding the mainframe environment, the assessment process, and the discovery process. </p><p>Some modernization experts use their own proprietary terminologies for activities that are categorized as “assessment” and “discovery” in this chapter. Nor would they agree with this guide’s description of what constitutes “assessment” and “discovery.” Some experts, for example, Micro Focus, refer to their assessment/discovery process as “Application Modernization Assessment.” </p><p>Irrespective of how modernization vendors name and describe their respective assessment/discovery activities, what is common to them all is that each undertakes preliminary activities to quickly obtain a panoramic picture of what the IT environment contains and what is going on inside it. These activities in turn may be grouped into less detailed and more detailed activities—for example, a questionnaire would form part of the less detailed activities, whereas an analysis of program logic would form part of the more detailed activities. </p><p>Thus, the categories “assessment” and “discovery” described here should be understood to refer broadly to such less detailed and more detailed activities that are undertaken as preliminary task to determine which, if any, modernization strategy will work best for you.</p><H3 class="subHeading">A Framework for Understanding the Mainframe Environment</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>A&amp;D experts use a conceptual framework in order to think about and understand a complex system. This framework is a tool that divides the system into smaller and smaller subsystems and this de-composition makes it possible to understand its complexity, or sometimes simply its immensity.</p><p>The following are some of the main reasons for adopting a conceptual framework:</p><ul><li><p><b>Holistic approach.</b> A holistic approach is the most effective way to analyze the interdependencies among the components of the mainframe environment. </p></li><li><p><b>Analytical checklist.</b> The framework serves as the basis for generating a hierarchical checklist of items in the mainframe environment. Detailed questions can then be asked about each item. </p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img class="note" src="local/note.gif"/>Note:</th></tr><tr><td><p>For a sample checklist, see the appendix, “Sample Questions for an Assessment/Discovery Project.”</p></td></tr><p/></table></div></li><li><p><b>Infrastructure of the new environment.</b> A conceptual framework can serve as a guide to determine which parts of the existing environment will map to their corresponding parts in the new infrastructure.</p></li><li><p><b>Minimizing risks.</b> A conceptual framework provides an effective method to identify the risks that a specific feature of the mainframe environment might pose in a migration project.</p></li></ul></content><H3 class="subHeading">The Assessment Process</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The A&amp;D process consists of two main phases: assessment and discovery. The assessment phase is the shorter of the two. Its aim is to obtain a preliminary, high-level understanding of the mainframe environment. Some A&amp;D experts use a questionnaire as the basis of assessment. The answers to the questionnaire are evaluated and a decision is taken whether the enterprise should move to the next phase: discovery.</p><p>Unless the objective at the outset is to migrate everything and eliminate the mainframe, the assessment must make an initial selection of which applications should be the subject of any follow-on discovery project.</p></content><H3 class="subHeading">The Discovery Process</H3><div class="subSection"/><content><p>The discovery phase typically lasts several weeks. It focuses on analysis of the candidate applications to decide which should be modernized, and how. Discovery tools—for example, code-scanning tools—form an important part of this investigation. The main objectives of discovery are:</p><ul><li><p><b>Selecting candidate applications and data for modernization.</b> The discovery process identifies applications and data for modernization. In the case of migrating from one platform to another, it also identifies components that might not migrate smoothly and that might require special strategies to ensure that they convert correctly to the new platform.</p></li><li><p><b>Identifying requirements for the target infrastructure.</b> A thorough understanding of the existing environment forms the basis upon which to define the infrastructure and architecture requirements of the new environment and for mapping existing operational procedures to the new environment. This mapping ensures that the applications continue to operate smoothly in their post-migration life with levels of availability better than or equivalent to those provided by the mainframe.</p></li><li><p><b>Choosing a modernization solution.</b> The discovery process evaluates the various modernization strategies against the characteristics of the assessed application(s) and your business objective for these applications, and recommends a strategy. The options are:</p><ul><li><p><b>Maintain current systems.</b> This option may make sense if the assessment suggests that in order to provide a return on modernization investment, the application will not be used for many years into the future, or if the risk of changing it is too high for the enterprise and the legacy application continues to meet business needs and provides business value.</p></li><li><p><b>Re-host.</b> Re-hosting is a relatively fast and cost-effective option to port or re-platform from the mainframe to another system environment. It allows enterprises to continue using the same application systems they rely on today—and in many cases the same COBOL or other code in which these applications are programmed. Because a re-hosted application is now running on Windows as are the clients that use the application, it can often be more easily “wrapped” in a powerful GUI or extended with a Web services front end than when it was hosted on the mainframe.</p></li><li><p><b>Re-engineer.</b> Re-engineering takes advantage of modern programming languages, tools and approaches, and more recent innovations such as automated code transformation into new languages. These new techniques re-engineer the existing application and transform it into new code. This new code can also be extended into a Service-Oriented Architecture using Web services, typically extending the capabilities of the system using Microsoft .NET. Re-engineering the applications re-develops them in the new code that preserves their structure, functionality, and interfaces with other existing systems and applications.</p></li><li><p><b>Re-architect.</b> Re-architecting an application is a step beyond re-engineering: It consists of designing an entirely new architecture and then writing a completely new application that meets all current and anticipated future business needs. A successful re-architecting approach usually results in the most efficient and effective applications that are much easier to maintain and extend.</p></li><li><p><b>Consolidate.</b> Consolidation is required by regulatory changes and new business requirements, such as moving to a new currency system or numbering convention. It eliminates duplication by moving data and functionality to a smaller number of systems to integrate complex, disparate systems. It involves developing a cross-application architecture that supports your current systems. (Consolidation is also referred to as “remediation” by some modernization vendors.)</p></li><li><p><b>Replace.</b> In this option, the legacy system is replaced with a new commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) application product. For example, an existing manufacturing work-in-process and inventory control system might be replaced with a commercial product. This option is potentially less costly than re-architecting the application; it makes sense to use this option when the capabilities of a COTS application match your requirements and when your existing applications will not be able to accommodate your anticipated business needs.</p></li></ul></li></ul></content></content>

It identifies modernization options for your studied applications and what would be involved to adopt any one of those paths to modernize your environment. However, the A&amp;D project and the modernization options it presents focus exclusively on the technological aspects of your mainframe environment. They do not consider the financial aspects associated with these options; nor do they typically include a decision analysis process for comparing the modernization options and for arriving at a decision about the best option for your enterprise.</p><p>There are two other steps after completing an A&amp;D project that you need to consider before you start a modernization project:</p><ul><li><p><b>Return on investment (ROI) and total cost of ownership (TCO).</b> This step consists of conducting a financial analysis of the modernization options, including ROI and TCO. For many enterprises, an ROI/TCO analysis is the main factor that enables them to decide which modernization option to choose.</p></li><li><p><b>Decision analysis.</b> Although ROI/TCO is a critical factor in determining which modernization option to choose, it is not the only factor; there are other non-financial factors to consider too—for example, risk, performance, security, or future adaptability. A comprehensive decision analysis of the modernization options offers the best way for weighing the various trade-off factors—including ROI/TCO—associated with each option and arriving at the best modernization strategy for your enterprise. Some partners and MCS already include an analysis of these trade-offs in their discovery process. In the case of A&amp;D projects undertaken by these partners or MCS, a separate decision analysis step may not be necessary.</p></li></ul><p>Microsoft’s partners as well as Microsoft Consulting Services can provide the services you will need to implement these two follow-up steps.</p></content></content>
